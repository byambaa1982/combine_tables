# Combining multitables on key

## Goal
The look in stop_times.txt we can see there are 33 rows in that file with this trip id. Each row represents a stop on the trip for this specific trip.
From trips.txt we also get that the service_id = 116
Looking in calendar_dates for this service id we can see that it is valid every day in the requested period (February 24 to March 1st) . This means that there will be 7*32 lines added to the new file for this trip. 32 sub_trips every day in that week.
