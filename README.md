# Combining multitables on key

## Goal
One of my customers sent me the following message on fiverr: `I need help creating one table/CSV-file from a few different tables (in GTFS-format).` 
There are three different tables. `trips.txt calendar.txt and stop_times.txt`. The goal is that I needed to combine them and made some data engineering. 

### Calendar dates
